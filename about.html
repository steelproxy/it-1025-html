    <h3>The man the myth the legend:</h2>
    <p>My name is Collin Rodes, I am a fan of run down 90s cars, and static HTML, no need for any of that fancy stuff.
        I really enjoy writing code occasionally, but I spend most of my time on other more mechanical projects.
        I've been messing around with computers as long as I can remember, as a kid I would go dumpster diving and rooting around the attic for any old hardware I could find and slapping it together - when I wasn't too busy dissasembling all the TV's in the house.

    <h3>My Car:</h3>
    <p>
        I have an unhealthy occasionally obessive relationship with my <strong>NINETEEN NINETY NINE Toyota Corolla.</strong>
        This is what occupies most of my time. 
        It is on its second or third EVERYTHING, from the motor, alternators, wheel bearings, ball joints, gas tanks, ETC!!
        I bought it for 2000 dollars almost 8 years ago at a salvage yard.
        No idea what the actual mileage on it is considering i've replaced everything multiple times over but i would say mmmmm, maybe around <strong>300k</strong>, give or take a little. 
        Its rusty, beat up, been ran through the mud and abused in ways that I probably don't even want to try and remember. It's been up and down the entire east cost and its still running strong today. I drive it up to new york every few months, a little shaky at times but never fails to get me there. <small> and its got two step and a few thousand dollars worth of subwoofers in it.</small>
